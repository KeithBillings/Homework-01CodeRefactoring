# Homework-01CodeRefactoring
Example of taking an existing website, and refactoring it to make it look the same on the outside, but work better under the hood.

### What I did: 

	First I made this repository to host the example of the existing website.
	
	I then added the example website to the repository via upload from my school's homework folder
	
	With the example website now being hosted on my GitHub, I then created a branch of the repository
	
	I cloned it, and downloaded it onto my computer to begin editing it
	
	Next, I used VSC to work on the website and refactor it
	
	Once I was finished, I committed my changes (via the GitBash console within VSC) and pushed it to the branch I created to simulate myself proposing project changes to a group. 
	
	Being a group of one, I approved the changes that were committed, and merged the branch into the Master
