# Homework-01CodeRefactoring
Example of taking an existing website, and refactoring it to make it look the same on the outside, but work better under the hood.

### What I did: 

	First I made this repository to host the example of the existing website.
	
	I then added the example website to the repository via upload
	
	Next, I used VSC to work on the website on my local computer
	
	Once I was finished, I committed my changes via the GitBash console within VSC
